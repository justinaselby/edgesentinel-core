# EdgeSentinel 🦉🛡️

**Patent Pending · Application #63/791,410 · Filed April 19, 2025**

EdgeSentinel is a lightweight, offline-capable Endpoint Detection & Response (EDR) system designed specifically for:
- Edge infrastructure
- Air-gapped environments
- Embedded systems
- Domain Controllers

## 🔍 Why EdgeSentinel?

Many critical devices are left unprotected by modern EDR platforms. EdgeSentinel provides visibility, behavioral monitoring, and local peer-to-peer threat telemetry — all without needing cloud access.

---

## ⚙️ Key Features (Planned)

- Offline behavioral detection engine
- Peer-to-peer IOC sharing via local mesh
- Power-aware operation modes
- Domain Controller monitoring (privilege abuse, LDAP tampering, etc.)
- Rollback support to signed baseline configs

---

## 📁 Repo Structure

- `/src` — Code for the detection agent, P2P modules, and more
- `/docs` — Vision, architecture diagrams, and design planning

---

## 🚧 Status

This project is in its early **vision-building** stage.
Contributions and interest are welcome as development ramps up.
