# EdgeSentinel 🦉🛡️  
**Patent Pending · Application #63/791,410 · Filed April 19, 2025**

**EdgeSentinel** is a lightweight, offline-capable Endpoint Detection & Response (EDR) system designed specifically for:

- Edge infrastructure  
- Air-gapped environments  
- Embedded systems  
- Domain Controllers  

---

## 🔍 Why EdgeSentinel?

Many critical devices are left unprotected by modern EDR platforms. EdgeSentinel provides visibility, behavioral monitoring, and local peer-to-peer threat telemetry — all without needing cloud access.

---

## ⚙️ Key Features (Planned)

- Offline behavioral detection engine  
- Peer-to-peer IOC sharing via LAN mesh  
- Modular AI engine for real-time behavioral anomaly detection  
- AI-assisted threat classification and response recommendations  
- Human-in-the-loop analysis with AI-generated summaries  
- Autonomous suppression of confirmed false positives  
- Compact footprint for embedded/low-resource environments  
- Federated learning capabilities for privacy-preserving model updates

## 🤖 AI Module: EdgeSentinel.AI

**EdgeSentinel.AI** augments traditional detection with artificial intelligence:

1. **Detection First**  
   Lightweight AI models monitor edge activity and flag unusual behaviors with threat-likelihood scores.

2. **Human-Guided Analysis**  
   Analysts are provided with natural-language summaries of suspicious activity for fast, informed triage.

3. **Smart Autonomy**  
   Confirmed false positives are remembered and suppressed automatically. Containment actions are only taken when verified by prior human feedback.

This hybrid system learns over time, combining the pattern-recognition power of AI with the judgment and intuition of skilled defenders — a true *symbiotic security* approach.

---

## 📦 Deployment Goals

EdgeSentinel is being developed to run on:

- Raspberry Pi, Jetson Nano, and similar SoCs  
- Industrial control systems and local Windows/Linux servers  
- Air-gapped operational technology (OT) environments  

---

## 🌐 Vision

Our mission is to provide security where it's needed most — **on the edge**.  
EdgeSentinel empowers defenders with a tool that learns, adapts, and protects even when the internet is unavailable.  
With **EdgeSentinel.AI**, we bring the intelligence *to* the device — not the other way around.

---

**Built for defenders. Powered by intuition. Grown through intelligence.**
