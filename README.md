# 🛡️ EdgeSentinel: Defend the Edge. Define the Future.

**Hi, I’m Justina Selby — cybersecurity analyst, IR specialist, and creator of EdgeSentinel.**

EdgeSentinel is a lightweight, offline-capable Endpoint Detection & Response (EDR) system designed specifically for:
- Air-gapped environments
- Edge infrastructure
- Domain Controllers
- Environments where visibility is usually limited

Built from real-world pain and persistence, EdgeSentinel was created to answer the question no platform could:  
**"What protects the protectors when the network goes dark?"**

### 🔍 Core Vision:
- **No cloud dependency**
- **Peer-to-peer IOC sharing**
- **AI-enhanced behavioral detection**
- **Built for defenders — not dashboards**

> “Honey, you couldn’t handle half of me.” — and that goes for your malware too.

### 🚧 Status:
Currently under active development. Patent-pending.  
You can’t stop what you can’t see — but EdgeSentinel is here to *change that.*
