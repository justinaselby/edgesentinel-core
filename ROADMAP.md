# 🛣️ EdgeSentinel Development Roadmap

---

## ✅ Phase 1: Core System MVP (In Progress)
- [x] Offline behavioral monitoring agent  
- [x] Local log collection and basic alerting  
- [ ] Peer-to-peer IOC sharing over LAN mesh  
- [ ] CLI-based management and alert dashboard  

---

## 🚧 Phase 2: AI Module — EdgeSentinel.AI (Detection Layer)
- [ ] Integrate lightweight ML model for local anomaly detection  
- [ ] Develop scoring system for threat likelihood  
- [ ] Include modular config to enable/disable AI module  

---

## 🧠 Phase 3: Human-Guided Threat Triage
- [ ] Generate natural-language summaries of AI-detected events  
- [ ] Simple UI/CLI feedback loop for human analysts to verify alerts  
- [ ] Store confirmed false positives and enrich future detections  

---

## 🤖 Phase 4: Smart Autonomy Layer
- [ ] Build auto-suppression logic for repetitive false positives  
- [ ] Safe-mode autonomous containment (e.g., kill process, block IP)  
- [ ] Add audit trail logging for all AI-driven actions  

---

## 🔐 Phase 5: Privacy + Federated Learning
- [ ] Support local model updates from approved training data  
- [ ] Explore federated learning frameworks (e.g., Flower, PySyft)  
- [ ] Research OT-safe AI model update strategies  

---

## 🌍 Phase 6: Public Beta + Community Feedback
- [ ] Launch pilot with early adopters (open or invite-only)  
- [ ] Collect performance data from diverse environments  
- [ ] Refine based on real-world edge use cases and user input
